"The horrendously ignorant and homophobic comments in response to this video are sad to read. They demonstrate a clear lack of general education and critical thinking skills in the region and how political  interests easily manipulate the people.
 
The list was much too short.  No mention of Ghana as minority party members in parliament raced to force through their own copy-cat  anti-LGBTQ  bill.

Also, no mention was made on the influence of American far-right evangelical Christian influence in Africa.

And one last observation:  was the voice over just a bad AI attempt at narration ?  An actual native speaker of standard English would never mispronounce so many common words or place names words!,";0;0;0;0
God bless Zambia;0;0;0;0
It must be common to their cities since they have ordered  punishments.  Otherwise  what would be the reason for planning.  It is most likely common like in america;0;0;0;0

Anal exams has to be the *GAYEST* thing a country can do‚ Africans hate colonists, but love the laws the white man made. Show me homophobia in Africa before colonization, I'll wait.;1;0;1;1

It's not a choice and homosexuality has existed since the beginning of times. Sexuality actually starts months before birth. Read more books. People like you are unnatural and should be banned in every single way.;1;0;0;0

I am an Ethiopian most of us I hope believe this LGBT  comes from Sodom and Gomora countries burned by God almighty so this act does not come from the normal mind of any people it comes from an abnormal mindset set and it shows people live like an lost their thinking. That is why they even try to show how much they are trying to convince themselves and others they are beautiful. but the truth is I think this kind of act they did unnecessarily make up, the body act is unnatural because even this kind of act is not acceptable to them they try to convince themselves that why they try to show themselves try to show to each act. if it is natural why they act like that. Because this act is shown to anyone who has some good mind will see the truth This is forbidden for God following person. if anyone wants to deliver from this kind of act you know who you are pls think God loves all of us but he hates such kind of behaviour. you might be in this community because of rape or someone heart you. the pain might be very strong I am really sorry for what happened to you but if you are willing God will heal the broken heart and soul. So God wants us to live his way and his commandment pls consider and live life fully by receiving God's begotten son Jesus Christ. Pls pray to God by the mercy of God he will guide you in the truth. You can see from the bible Romans 1:27-28 pls don't hate me try to see how much God loves all of us he wants us to live a peaceful life in our hearts. thanks for understanding;1;0;1;1

"As a black gay I'm really sad to see these comments I don't want to change anyone's views I just want to LIVE! Killing us is crazy especially since the same bible says eating the wrong food makes you less holy [Lev. 20:25]. Having a tattoo makes you less holy [Lev. 19:28]. Wearing clothes from different fibres like wool and linen together makes you less holy [Lev. 19:19]. Even having a physical disability makes you less holy [Lev. 21:16-23]. 

Are we going to take those seriously as well?";0;0;0;0
Yeah I'm not gay but the hypocrisy from Africans is interesting. People like to pick and choose what parts they want to focus on;0;0;0;0
You, apparently, don't give a damn what it says, so why should we care?;0;0;0;0
I'm actually Muslim. Look at what the gay agenda did to European and American culture.;0;1;0;0
You're no longer black. We disown you. Go hang out with ladyboys in Thailand if you want.;1;1;1;1

The New testament also condemns homosexuality;0;1;0;0
Christians don't read their own bible.;0;0;0;0
The whole bible must be taken seriously. I recommend you to change your way, because this will never ever be accepted in the black community all around the world. The only people of color who will accept the rainbow are black feminist in America. As long as you live you still have a chance to be saved by Jesus Christ if you repent! Repent my brother!;0;0;0;0
I keep wondering who gave you this so called right to homosexuality?;1;0;0;0
I Am with you my brother! these comments are gross. MY heart is broken.;0;0;0;0
"shadycnetwork You're wrong.

I may not know everything about the Bible, but growing up with religion enforced on me physically has made me very familiar with it. Despite being homosexual, I can confidently say that the Bible does not explicitly condemn acting on homosexuality.

 God's love has no boundaries, it encompasses all and is unconditional. It goes beyond human understanding and transcends differences. This love is not constrained by societal norms or personal preferences, it welcomes all individuals regardless of sexual orientation. 

 Love is the force that draws us nearer to God and enables us to form meaningful connections with others. What holds significance in the eyes of God is not who we love, but the manner in which we express love.

God's primary nature is love, not hatred. We hold the belief that God is concerned with our sexual orientation rather than our theological orientation. The crucial question was never  not ""who do you love?"" but ""do you love?"" Jesus conveyed the same message to gay individuals as he did to everyone else: God's love surpasses all understanding and encourages individuals to walk in love with God and one another.";0;0;0;0
Romans 1:26 and 27. 1st Corinthians 6:9. 1st Timothy 1:10 Jude 1:7. Just to name a few. Yes God is love but he's also Justice and holiness.;0;0;0;0
You cited the leviticus priest protocol for the operation of the tabernacle. however deleting homsexuality is a command. if you really believe in God you would turn away from that because it is one of the sin that is punishable by being deleted. If you regret your sins, give your life to Christ and repent from your sins. As long as you are breathing it is not to late to repent. If you need prayers, just ask!;0;0;0;0

you do realize these morals come frome europe;0;0;0;0

Where? Other than north Africa and Ethiopia, where? Tell me.;0;0;0;0
So you're saying Africans didn't have morals before colonialism, is that right?;0;0;0;0
Actually they're defending the morals and values of US evangelical Christians;0;0;0;0
But you rather that we replace them with the value and morals pushed by the US government, right? Lol;0;0;0;0
actually little buddy Christianity spread through Africa long before Europe so those Christian biblical morals were in Africa first. The world's oldest full Bible is African. You really need to do your research there snowflake.;0;0;0;0
I said my previous comment not really. Christianity spread through Africa long before Europe. I understand you're ignorant you don't know any better but bless your heart.;1;0;0;0
bless your heart' is usually what smug ignorant 'christians' say when they're doing what they do best - spreading their message of hate. It would seem your ignorance is far clearer than any perceived ignorance on my part - btw, 'you're ignorant you don't know any better' is just the sort of language colonial powers used to justify their treatment of those they occupied - you've clearly learned the wrong lessons in your life.;1;0;0;0

Europeans are the cause of the spread of AIDS and famine in Africa.  Europe's entire economy is based on stealing the resources of the African continent and the Middle East..

Christianity is not from the white. Educate yourself and fix your mindset;0;0;0;0
I implore you to heed your own advice because the missionaries came to Alkebulan for a reason, to introduce their Christianity with the aim of dividing us mentally, then it was LITERALLY used to control us through slavery but keep on telling me I need to educate myself whilst not even providing an iota of evidence to back up your claims other than emotion. WAKE UP, daddy in the sky is from yt folks to control the masses, snd it's still working.;0;0;0;0
who said the bible is from the YT person. That's what you need to educate yourself on dear, Not everything we have belongs to the YT people;0;0;0;0
I LITERALLY just gave you a synapses of how it happened I love the arrogance some of my brothers and sisters have when faced with opposing views, knowledge and facts. We're clearly on the sides we're on, leave it alone- since you think you know it all, stick wit ya book of fantasies that's had over 256 documented revisions, while telling me the yt man's ultimate tool in mind control still ain't working on you. Right go off sis and daddy in the sky is about to smite me, huh? ­ be real and learn to question shit force fed to you, perhaps you'll stop trying to talk to me like you know what you're talking about when it's you, who needs to fix their mindset. You can't even defend your stance, yet, trying to chastise me??? stop it «all you have to do is look up WHY the missionaries started coming to Alkebulan, it's all very clear to those that are willing to do the work to unlearn the bullshit we've all been fed through whitewashed history. Some are just slower than others in figuring that out and you're clearly among that group. Wake up sis, they may have stolen the concept of the bible from Judah, but y'all still praising white Jesus, treating yt Folks better than and kissing their asses while shitting on our own. I'm very historically aware, so unless you're bringing facts to back up your claims, just stop. I'm always willing to change my mind when presented with facts, not opinions or emotions;1;0;0;0
Christianity is a Middle Eastern religion. Also, since you against colonialism, you must be against western countries pushing these lgbtq ideologies is africa, right?;0;0;0;0
if Christianity is a middle eastern religion, why is the vatican in Rome the LITERAL center of it?? Middle easterners are largely Muslim, no Christian so what are you talking about??  as for agendas and ideologies, I'm against people pushing their beliefs onto anyone, including hate rooted in ignorance and the fact that you think someone chooses to be gay let's me know the caliber of intelligence I'm dealing with. Riddle me this, when did you decide to become straight? For the record, I'm against anyone pushing anything on anyone because as I said, minding one's own business never steered anyone wrong  It's the meddling in others affairs when problems start. What two consenting adults do behind closed doors has what to do with you or anyone else? An agenda or ideology is what neocolonialism is, what apartheid was, what Jim Crow is here in America, what the Berlin conference was that got Africa where it is today. So yeah, 'm against others mind the business of others ESPECIALLY, when it has nothing to do with them. Trying to conflate issues that aren't the same isn't an effective strategy if you're referring to children because that I'm wholeheartedly against, but grown ass people doing what they want, nah, I could care less. There are much bigger problems to have such strong feelings about and to think there aren't gay people right there in Africa is simply comical and speaks to the very hate y'all Christians promote and embrace while talking out the sides of your asses with a book literally used to justify the enslavement of our ancestors. Was your wife a virgin when you married? Cause if not, she's supposed to be stoned to death. You know a good Christian is a good slave, right? WAKE UP, no one chooses to be gay but people choose to be stupid, gay people are everywhere, you're dumb if you think Africa is gay free and has always been, anyone that believes that is lying to themselves and putting their ignorance on full display.;1;0;0;0

African countries do not accept homosexuality because of our cultural, religion plays very little in our view of this evil alternative lifestyle. The only country in Africa that accept homosexuals is South Africa. I wonder why my country is in a mess both politically and economically.;0;0;0;0
Always astounds me that these desperately poor and socially backward countries should put so much effort into criminalising consensual relationships between adults when they have far more important and desperate issues to address - I guess politicians will always exploit the most vulnerable in order to deflect from their weaknesses and to shore up power among their following;0;0;0;0
Kwenda huko,let us be backward instead of dealing with social misfit.;0;0;0;0
The greatness of any society is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable and weak...and justifying persecution on religious grounds is the hallmark of the most morally bankrupt governments in history.;0;0;0;0
Absolute moron. Go ahead and continues suffering then;1;1;0;1
Ok. Let it these relationships stay in your world as we deal with our backwardness. These relationships won't help in any way except Old people wearing pampers;0;0;0;0
Going our of your way to spend time and money Imprisoning these people will only cause more harm to you;0;0;0;0
"Why should we spend money taking care of people who add up to the health, financial and social burden of society, when cannon water is a big problem for us.
In fact, because we are poor, we don't need anything that adds to our burdens. We wont use our taxes to cure people's anuses and damaged vaginas because they want something which is out of the norm. Or for people who think animal sexual contact is better. If you like it, keep it, but we won't ve party to it.";1;0;0;0
our most vulnerable in Africa are women, children and the disabled. Nobody is aware of lgbt until they start rubbing it in our faces, which is why that Ugandan interviewer was clueless about gays. The average African doesn't have the time and comfort to think about decadence;0;0;0;0
"By 'decadence' do you mean human rights? The point is that you've survived perfectly well without these draconian laws, why go through all the effort to introduce them now - and the additional expense of policing consensual acts?...as previously stated, it's because your government has run out of ideas on how to address the real problems of the country, so they're using vulnerable people to criminalise and deflect people's attention - don't worry, developed countries do it too.

How is the child poverty and education system in your country? - there's your reason";0;0;0;0
Homosexuality is not our culture. Its a taboo to our African society and values. So keep that gay lifestyle in your so called developed western society…;0;0;1;0
Ignorance and poverty goes hand in hand.;0;0;0;0
True - but you don't have to be poor to be ignorant - the US has a very high number of ignorant people...many of them in government.;0;0;0;0
Let us worry about our poverty and you worry about your pronouns while China is beating your economy. If being advanced is trying to change how people are I WILL CHOOSE TO LIVE IN POVERTY. There are only 2 genders. Male and Female, no amount of make up, weave, surgery and hormonal medication will fix your mental problem.;1;0;0;0
Europeans are the cause of the spread of AIDS and famine in Africa.  Europe's entire economy is based on stealing the resources of the African continent and the Middle East..  It is good that African governments are beginning to wake up and stand against this disgust and toxic ideas that Europeans are trying to spread in the world. At first the West targeted young men, now they target children without shame.,;1;0;1;1
What about racism and persecution against Muslims in Europe, preventing Muslim girls from wearing the hijab in France, and kidnapping tens of thousands of Arab and Muslim children in Europe every year and handing them over to perverts and rapists?..50% of mosques in Sweden have been attacked and burned, and the perpetrator is always unknown despite the presence of cameras.. Instead of arresting these Nazi racists, you monitor Muslims and practice the Inquisition against them and their families to find false justifications for kidnapping their children, and fabricating charges against them.;1;0;0;0
Not only that, but many of those ridiculous laws are from white culture that once enslaved them…;0;0;0;0
Just look at what is going on in your country coz of gender ideology, while you were obsessing over gender ideologies, China and Russia stepped in to establish themselves as the super powers while your country was being sisified;0;0;0;0
That doesn't make China or Russia socially successful - I wonder in which country has a higher rate of national happiness and contentment? Australia or China?  The success of a nation is judged by how fairly and justly its people are treated - China and Russia are both abject failures when it comes to that measure.,;0;0;0;0
Would that be the same society that enslaved three quarters of the world and colonised and stole their land.  Constantly exploiting the poor country's raw resources?  Engages in world wars?  A society that indiscriminately dropped nuclear bombs on innocent civilians?  A society that pollutes the rest of the planet and prevents developing countries from engaging in the Industrial Revolution?  I'll wait.;0;0;0;0
"If you can live with slavery on your conscience, I think we'll do just fine with ""dealing"" with a few reprobates. Lol.  Stay out of Africa.";0;0;0;0

Are you normal?;1;0;0;0
Depends on what I imagine is your rather narrow view of 'normal',;0;0;0;0
"""Socially backwards"" Listen, you racist, these countries don't have the history of slavery, biological warfare, genocide, weapons of mass destruction,  and wiping out the indigenous population that you have.,";1;0;0;0
China and Russia would Crush the EU and NATO in months.;0;0;0;0
Homosexual acts are not a human right. The reasons for these new laws are to make sure that the ongoing effort of western countries to push their homosexual ideologies fail.;1;1;1;1
At least in my poor socially backward country we do not inject our children with puberty blockers and hormones or  mutilate them.;0;0;0;0
Did you expect our leaders to sit down and do nothing while western countries are pushing their dangerous ideologies in our countries? Our leaders are fighting against a serious problem, they not deflecting.;0;0;0;0
Do you serious expect Africans to sit down and let western governments push their ideologies onto us? Well, that's f***** too bad because Africans are finally starting to stand up for ourselves and we know that make y'all mad because you are used to get things your way.;0;0;0;0
"Firstly you should be aware that it is the US Christian fundamentalists who are pressuring your governments to push this hate agenda - these are not 'African principles' - so you are being controlled by western countries anyway. Secondly, your country has far more serious problems like illiteracy, child poverty and health and education issues which it SHOULD be dealing with.

 Can't you see that all this attacking of minorities is just your government distracting its people from the real problems?...the ones that it can't or refuses to sort out? I can assure you the same thing happens with western governments so I'm very familiar with this tactic.,";0;0;0;0
You also don't have enough food for them - and as for mutilating them, please remember that Africa is the main offender when it comes to FGM;0;0;0;0
Yet alot of powerful rich Middle East and Asia countries are against homosexuality.;0;0;0;0
You are half right. Powerful Islamic countries are against it, but East Asian countries are actually more liberal regarding homosexuality. Look up Thailand, China, Philippines, Japan, South Korea. Homosexuality has been legalized in China since 1997, and that is one example. I'll leave the rest to you.;0;0;0;0
In all those places homosexuality is frowned upon by the majority of the population. That's what we are talking about here. We aren't talking about legal status.;0;0;0;0
So does America, homosexuality is frowned by most, but it is legal. The law trumps whatever anyone feels. We are talking about legal status, someone didn't pay attention to the OP.;0;0;0;0
"""Ignorance goes hand and hand with poverty"" 

How tf is this comment talking about the legal status of homosexuality?";1;0;0;0
OP(original post), which means the post at the very top made by that these comments are under. You just lost yourself trying to be smart with me.;0;0;0;0
Your claims are independent from the OP. I was addressing your claims. Not the OP ones.;0;0;0;0
Which of the claims exactly?;0;0;0;0
"""Ignorance and poverty go hand in hand""

That claim.";0;0;0;0
Countries that are allowing men on men sex are the ones that are socially behind. These countries are 100% correct off you look at what the American society has degenerated;1;0;1;1
Ignorance and poverty does go hand in hand. Inhabitants of third world countries tend to have less knowledge of making wealth, and also blame their poverty on marginalized people within their nation claiming if they get rid of them, things would be much better economically. On the other hand, wealthy nations tend to be more progressive in thought and actions.;0;0;0;0
Tell me what 3rd world countries blamed marginalized groups for poverty? Tell me exactly what African nation did that? Also, again, your claims are false because there're a lot of developed countries that do not allow homosexuality. And don't forget the fact that the countries that allow homosexuality were developed hundreds of years before allowing homosexuality.;0;0;0;0
There is Uganda(research Musevini's speeches regarding homosexuality and what his supporters think about it)and Kenya, just to name a couple because I'm not trying to write a whole book talking about the many countries in Africa against homosexuality. You stated that there are developed countries that do not allow homosexuality and Then you stated that those developed counties that allowed homosexuality were developed hundreds of years ago, which I already know. You are now contradicting yourself further proving my point.;0;0;0;0
 I'm Tanzanian. Ugandans are our neighbors, I know more about museveni than you ever could. There's no single museveni speech that he blamed homosexuals for uganda's economic status. That's false. Also, I pointed out the fact that those developed countries were developed long before they legalized homosexuality   ergo, allowing homosexuality had no part in their economic development. So, how is that a contradiction?;0;0;0;0
You didn't research Musevini's speeches and you are lying again. You also proved my point again that ignorance and poverty correlate by stating that Homosexuals don't contribute to a growth of society economically. In America we have many artists, politicians, actors, and inventors in the past and present that are gay. Get educated.;0;0;0;0
Thank God.;0;0;0;0
Provide a link to anything that supports your claims. ANYTHING, an article, a video, an audio, etc. ANYTHING. I dare you.;0;0;0;0
Speaking of ignorance, have you heard about the concept of burden of proof? Well, it's simply means it's up to a person that makes claims to prove those claims. It's not up to me to do any research to prove your claims. It's up to you. Now, please go ahead and provide a link to an article, a video, an audio, or anything that supports your claims. Go ahead and prove you false claims. I'll be waiting;0;0;0;0
The video poster deleted my comment with the links multiple times. The poster is biased.;0;0;0;0
"It's on a site called ""The Guardian."" The title is "" Uganda President calls on Africa 'the world from homosexuality."" What is Musevini inferring with his speech?";0;0;0;0
If you're really interested in finding out, you can do the research the same way I did. Please don't waste my time by challenging me in this way. In my vast experience of dealing with people like you on social media, I'm sure you'd refute any evidence I provided you with anyway.;0;0;0;0
Tell me the name of that video, article, or whatever so I can look for myself. I'll be waiting;0;0;0;0
Don't wait - do some research;0;0;0;0
food for fact if you look it up, all the countries that condemn homosexuality are either black or brown countries. All of the safest countries for gay people are predominantly white countries. Maybe America should be more like black and brown countries.;0;0;0;0
They are socially backwards because they don't want hiv and monkey pox in their countries.;0;0;0;0
Yes, that is exactly the case.;0;0;0;0
Burn Sin;1;0;1;1
To see the lineage of enslaved/colonized/and invaded black lands accept and propagate the teachings of their ancestors tormentors is a sad thing in deed...I hope one day Africa as a whole is able to overcome their mental shackles and embrace the excellence that they are made. But until then, I will pray for the safety of those black brothers and sisters  under the heel of black enforced colonial and archaic invader religious ideologies;0;0;0;0
Stop talking nonsense. Ancient Africans never accepted homosexuals. The one suffering from mental shackles is you, hence your love to sleep with someone of your gender. We are not gays in Africa.;1;0;1;1
Thank you. Everyone here is saying the west is trying to corrupt them as they preach the religon of the colonizers;0;0;0;0
you statement doesn't work for Ethiopia though. Ethiopia is a never been colonized country.;0;0;0;0
It was still threatened by colonization and foreign powers forcing their beliefs onto people. Meanwhile they try to force their own beliefs onto another group.;0;0;0;0
"Yes it was, Not physical taken but cas and point
Christianity makes up nearly 70% of Ethiopias religion. They didn't need to physically invade to take control of its culture and mentality cage its people, they colonized it through finance hence Ethiopia's past and currently social economic place in the world and its Christian religious adherence and absolution.";0;0;0;0
Ethiopia has been Christian from the beginning. Go and read the Bible and how many places Ethiopia has been mentioned. We been living naturally and we didn't get our cultural values from somewhere else. we never been gays and won't be.;0;0;0;0
"You didn't even take the time to research before responding. If you care to expand your knowledge  search the Aksumite Period, Awre the serpent King and Habesha. Believe what you will, it's your life...but even in Christianity Jesus never once killed, raped, outcast, or harmed those who were not part of his religious ideologies, instead he showered them with love...(imprison, forced conversion and hate for ""the gays"" doesn't sound like something he'd support) to be honest it sounds like you and those of your mind set would be one of the priest he beat on the sabbath";0;0;0;0
"Does the bible says anything about the Axumite period? If I need to research I would do it from the bible not google. and about homosexuality, Leviticus 20:13 reads as ''If a man has intercourse with a man as with a woman, both commit an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves..... 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 1 Timothy 1:8-10...";0;0;0;0
Ethiopia was the second Christian empire after Armenia. Their religion was by choice not colonialism;0;0;0;0
I implore you to read about the purpose of the Roman church sending their missionaries to Africa to LITERALLY dominate our minds just before the slave trade really started getting underway- they don't even live by the Bible but Christianity is yt folks means of controlling us Africans and it's still working on so many. I assure you, with this sentiment, it's illogical to think anyone would choose to be gay. Being gay is not confined to one region of the globe and it's extremely telling by anyone that claims to be Christian the hate and judgement they/y'all put on constant display instead of the love it preaches proves just how truly illogical the religion really is. Yt folks were and remain the problem as to why homosexuality was all of a sudden a problem.;0;0;0;0
"Arguing about the Bible is equivalent to arguing about the""Cat in the Hat"" and ""Jack in the Beanstalk"". Those books mentioned are all man made books written by men. The Bible was written to control the minds of people and enslave them. According to Christianity, the priesthood has been changed from the Levitical priesthood into the order of Melchizedek(Heb. Chapter 7), so why are you quoting LevIticus. Leviticus stems from the word Levite. As they say: Common sense is not common. 

Also in Jeremiah 8:8 it states: How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.";0;0;0;0
"""intercourse""? Lol so you're reading one of those new non god inspired monarchy/corporate translations bibles huh? No wonder your confused";0;0;0;0
I suggest you do some research on the science of conquest and the history of colonialism, it might help you better understand what it means to be conquered.;0;0;0;0
You said colonized, you saw the number 3 . Ethiopia has never been colonized and we stand on our feet about not accepting lgbtq.;0;1;0;0
This is the truth which they don't want to accept.;0;0;0;0
There was an Ethiopian person who was baptized by one of the disciples. I guess you missed that while you were reading your bible. And Ethiopia holds the most oldest and complete bible in the world. So no amount of you talking about accepting other countries religion will work with us;0;0;0;0
By the time the white people came to preach, Ethiopia was already a Christian country , so the jock is on you;0;0;0;0
They say ignorance is bliss. Sooo stay ignorant my friend, your life;0;0;0;0
No Christianity came to Ethiopia from Rome via Egypt over 1000 yrs ago, there was trading going on before Ethiopia embraced Christianity and it was done to solidify trade and busin6relationships (Same as how it came into west Africa in 1500s). The stories of the bible were written over a period of time  by different scholars and yes Ethiopia was in it, because during that time Ethiopia had relationships with Rome. Religion is a man made manipulative tool.;0;0;0;0
Leviticus also says eating the wrong food makes you less holy [Lev. 20:25]. Having a tattoo makes you less holy [Lev. 19:28]. Wearing clothes from different fibres like wool and linen together makes you less holy [Lev. 19:19]. Even having a physical disability makes you less holy [Lev. 21:16-23].;0;0;0;0
 The bible is a hoax, written by wicked humans. What is holy? The biblical God isn't holy, so what is?;1;0;0;0
Are you suggesting that Africans allowed, celebrated and encouraged homosexuality before colonialism? Do you have any reliable source to back up your claims? Y'all will make up anything push your bs.;0;0;0;0
The countries that colonized us are the ones that pushing for this ideologies today. So are you against that? Are you against western countries pushing lgbtq ideologies in africa?;0;0;0;0
Some of us want to build generational wealth over there but nope;0;0;0;0

Why? Why would you waste your resources persecuting those who've done you no harm?;0;0;0;0
waste resources? Persecute? OK we have stayed from generations to this period being straight not gay, straight. Isn't it wonderful that gay couples were birthed by straight people? If we have to keep the cycle going and probably be here longer and not go extinct, we have to shun the whole lgbtq+. Besides as President Kenyatta said: we have millions of people to feed so our thoughts shouldn't be on lgbtq+ also, we have our culture. We aren't persecuting anyone.;0;1;0;0
we have millions of people to feed.Then your thoughts shouldn't be on wasting money to imprison gay people. Are you in favor of arresting any random person who refuses to reproduce? Are you going to restrain them and have them r-worded? Are gay people going to magically start a family after being imprisoned? The problem is, you are gaining absolutely nothing from I'm prisoning them yet you're losing a lot. And culture, a gay person can have the exact same culture as you and you won't even care, but if they happen to be attracted to thesame sex, suddenly you start pissing and shitting.;1;0;0;0

Ps: The bible is older than 2000 years";0;0;0;0
"Show me the proof for an argument you never made
Nobody is forcing you to be gay. I said that people should be allowed to be gay if they want to. Going out of your way to spend time and money persecuting them is idiotic because
1. Someone being gay, harms no one.
2. Youre doing more harm than good to society by wasting money.
Are you gonna arrest everybody who refuses to procreate? Are you going to hold people down and forcefully make them have sex with people they are un attracted to? Are people in prison going to magically start a family after you hold them in there?

Sexual orientation isnt an investment, it's a preference, simple as that. Some people are born with a pleasure for certain things, and some develop one. Either way doesn't change the fact imprisoning them is idiotic.

And lmfao yeah let me use a fucking 10000 year old book to justify that something is bad because the said so, you just made your whole point that much dumber(shockingly).";1;0;0;0
You said the West needs to stay out of it yet you are practicing what the weather gave you under colonization. You sound stupid and you are doing exactly what your colonial masters wanted you to do, kill your own. Keep it up slave.;1;1;0;1
nobody wastes time persecuting them. Most people aren't even aware of them until they're vocal about their lives. We face real life challenges everyday like drought, potential wars and unrest, lack of education, floods, corruption etc. If we're lucky to advance industrially like other nations, we'll care about decadence then;0;0;0;0
wtf do you mean I'm not wasting time you're literally doing it right now. To stop prosecuting gay people wouldn't take ANY TIME away from doing those other things. But instead you're taking time AWAY from worrying about actual harmful shit Africans face and as I said, your putting that time into shitting on gay people.;1;0;0;0
you are mad, because that's not part of our culture and human race;1;0;0;0
So it's ok to arrest people for having a different culture?;0;0;0;0
African cultures doesn't have gays and lesbians, not on our continent;0;0;1;0

Male and female is determined by gender and until you accept that is truth you are in the Great Tribulation with the rest of the liars. The Great Tribulation started September 1st.

"she has a nasally voice, her songs are adored by drunk girls screaming her lyrics in my ears at parties, and her singles are lazy to me. i don't get the hype 

there's a few reasons i don't like her besides the cherry picked ones you gave";0;0;0;0
"I hated her music way before I knew she was even fat, black, and confident. Her ""singing"" is annoying, her music sounds like garbage, and the lyrics are stupid. Everything I hate about her is because of her music not her appearance.";1;1;1;1
Her Music sounds like a cat thrown up and a 12 year old girl singing to its beat while crying... Okay that was a bit harsch but honestly... I think her music isnt good... And i heard it a lot in the radio or bc someone puts it one(by joke to fuck with everyone's mood) and i didnt even knew till some time ago... But still her songs sounds shitty. As a person she is maybe okay... But in singing she is definitely mot good;1;0;1;1
" her music suckz
And her lyrics are ass";1;0;0;0
She has nothing to sing about other than her appearance. Needs a ghost writer or something. Her voice doesn't bother me just the absence of anything substantial in her lyrics.;0;0;0;0
I hate her for exactly none of those reasons. Her songs in general are fcking annoying, her lyrics are dumb and her voice isn't great imo, and on top of that they're overplayed to hell. Also she just kinda makes me cringe and idk why. There are a million other black and confident artists and creators that I adore but I can't stand lizzo. Don't fcking just call ppl who don't like her racists.;1;0;0;0
U fxkn kidding me. She twerked while playing that crystal flute. Disrespectful hore;1;1;1;1
People don't like her because she's fat. Yeah, it's that simple and yeah I'm blunt as hell! :);1;1;0;1
All she sings about is the fact that she's not the normal beauty standard, she has a shit voice and is carried by her sound track, and she also promotes body positivity then releases a line of clothing that's only goal is to make you look skinnier. PUT IN THE EFFORT?!?! She also has promoted unhealthy living styles in ads and has become a holy savant for people who don't want to take care of their bodies. She isn't even a good person, she isn't patient with others and is an absolute hypocrite when it comes to spreading love as she has definitely said some hatefully things.;0;0;0;0
I never actually minded her music prior I just wasn't a fan and I didn't get the hype. It wasn't until she used ableist slurs in one of her songs that I saw her as a red flag;0;0;0;0
"Her voice is annoying... also I don't like how she spreads the message that being morbidly obese is fine and  ""just sexualize yourself and you'll feel better"", when we should be supporting changes and not self love in these kind of situations. But I would never hate her because she's obese or black.";0;0;0;0
Cuz she only gets attention for being fat and gross.;1;1;1;1
I like her music and message, but she gives me some toxic optimism vibes.;0;0;0;0
She can't sing at all. I saw some delusional people saying she could in the comments of her tiny desk concert but to me she was out of breath, shouty, and her voice wasn't really connecting the way it should. Her head voice is okay but her voice is shaky. Her technique is just bad overall. Her tone is also not that great, but i guess that's subjective.;0;0;0;0
"I don't care if you're fat, but promoting obesity as if it's not a deadly condition that COULD KILL YOU pisses me off (also it's not body positivity it's straight up just saying you should be fat)

She's a shitty person inside and out but only got exposed from the postmates incident.  She's morbidly obese and stole her only hit from another rapper.  She wouldn't be relevant if she wasn't screaming fat shame when she's the bully thru and thru;1;0;1;1
I think she just speaks to those big girls with Attitudes that like skinny guys that don't like them. the majority of times. I like me some big girls. But Lizzo is just disgusting.;1;1;0;1
lol this sounds v. boomerish. Idk what a lazy single sounds like, but the goal of the single is for it to chart. The more simplistic, the better;0;0;0;0
"Yup. OP, you remember Missy Elliott, right? Talented and sweet....black, big, and confident. I love her. Most people had no issue with her in her hey day. Lizzo is rather off putting because of the CONSTANT 4th wave feminist (always love yourself) message in her lyrics... that's more arrogance and self-obsessed than confidence. Plus her music is not anything special. It's like songs white teenage girls (or even over the hill female divorcees) would play whilst they get dressed for a trashy night out at the club. Any decent sassy hip hop rnb loving lady be listening to something with more flavour and bounce, like Ella Mai, Aaliyah, Janet, Teedra Moses, Mellii...

She's what we'd call a flash in the pan because she seems popular because of sociopolitical trends rather than bringing in longevity and creative music trends.";0;0;0;0
exactly;0;0;0;0
Her attitude sucks in any color.;0;0;0;0
her narcissm coupled with watch me eat a burger behaviours and just medicore music;1;0;0;0
lol that's not sexual harassment? Do the dancers at the basketball games sexually harass everyone too?;0;0;0;0
yeah uh i'm more impressed with someone who makes good music for the sake of good music, not trying to make a catchy song that'll chart;0;0;0;0
Boomerish? People who hate her are from your judgemental asshole generation. Most boomers don't even know who tf she even is.;1;0;1;1
Lazy take;0;0;0;0
Don't make me hungry!;0;0;0;0
it's not catchy, it's awful she can't sing;0;0;0;0
you can do both. A lot of artists can't do either.;0;0;0;0
ok the dancers asses are out? Are they sexually harassing anyone? When a guy jogs with shirt off is he sexually harassing someone?;1;0;1;1
Lizzo only cares about her money, her music sucks and she's kept afloat by mindless sorority girls;0;0;1;0
Yeah and what's the difference?;0;0;0;0
